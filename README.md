# Research Internship â€“ IIT Bombay

**Dynamic Modelling of a Biogas-Based SOFC System for In-Situ Hydrogen Production and Power Generation**  
*Under the guidance of Prof. Sujit S. Jogwar, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay*  
*May 2025 â€“ July 2025*

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
This project focuses on the **dynamic modelling and control** of a biogas-fed **Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) system** designed for renewable power generation. The model integrates **in-situ hydrogen production** with electricity generation, capturing the coupled dynamics of:

- **Steam Reformer (SR)** â€“ methane/biogas reforming and waterâ€“gas shift  
- **SOFC Stack** â€“ electrochemical conversion and fuel utilisation  
- **Combustor** â€“ complete oxidation of residual fuels  
- **Heat Exchangers** â€“ thermal integration via energy recovery  

---

## ðŸ§© Key Contributions
- Developed and implemented **mass and energy balance equations** for SR, SOFC, combustor, and HX.  
- Incorporated **reforming reactions, electrochemical conversion, combustion, and energy recovery mechanisms**.  
- Analysed **system response under transient conditions**, including step changes in current demand.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Methods
- **MATLAB (ode15s)** for solving stiff ODE systems  
- **Orthogonal Collocation Method (OCM)** for discretising heat exchanger PDEs  
- **Dynamic simulation** for evaluating performance under varying loads
